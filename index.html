        <h4>Status: Paused</h4>
        <p>Project Empty is focused on easily making near perfect vacuums, free of almost all matter.</p>
        <p>The current plan is to design a handheld tool that selects an area and moves all matter in that area outside.</p>
        <p>The area would remain empty until the tool was toggles again.</p>
        <p>Research has been on and off, only working on it as a sort of side project when everything else is done.</p>

        <i><p>Notice: Project Glide has been put on hold indefinitly, and will not have any further work done on it.</p></i>
        <p>Project Glide was focused on making a minimal friction surface, designed to almost not affect motion on it at all.</p>
        <p>It was a primary project here at Parallel Labratories, and similar projects had been worked on at other companies.</p>
        <p>Much like other companies, it was deemed too difficult to make a frictionless medium relative to rewards from it, and was discontinued.</p>
